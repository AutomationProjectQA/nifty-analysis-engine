# Remediation Plan & Development Retrospective

> Compiled 2026-06-29. Inputs: the external audit (`docs/ENGINE_REVIEW_ALL_ISSUES.md`, `docs/AUDIT_PHASE18-20_TASKS.md`), the production fixes already made this session (`docs/ISSUES_AND_BACKLOG.md`), and direct code inspection.
> Read **Part A** (why) before **Part C** (the plan). Core symptom driving everything: **AI Signals generate (almost) no trades.**

## Part A — Why did this many issues accumulate? (honest retrospective)

The 226 audit findings + our own production bugs are **not random**. They cluster into **six systemic root causes**. Fixing the symptoms without fixing these will just regenerate them.

### R1. The system was built to *avoid bad trades*, not to *find good trades*
Risk philosophy was "maximum confirmation before trading." Over time, **independent hard gates were each added in isolation** — you can see the archaeology in the code comments (`P3-1` min-confirmation, `P3-3` direction consensus, `P5-1` strategy, `P5-5` freshness, session filter, liquidity floor, calibrated-probability gate…). Each gate was reasonable alone. **Nobody ever measured their cumulative effect.** The result is a funnel where every stage removes candidates until nothing survives (audit's central finding; verified in `DecisionAgent`).
- *Evidence:* `gating-threshold: 60` is the nominal bar, but the *effective* bar becomes `60 +8 (sideways) +10 (volatile) −15 (entry penalty) …` plus 3-of-4 consensus plus trend+flow+PCR confirmation plus liquidity ≥70. The compounding was never modelled.

### R2. Silent fallbacks hid failures instead of surfacing them
This is the **single biggest reason bugs survived undetected.** Throughout the codebase, when something failed it **returned plausible fake data and continued** as if healthy:
- Live market quote → hardcoded ~23,500 defaults, **still marked "Live"** (the index-quote bug we found this session).
- Option chain → flat simulated OI/IV.
- LLM reports/news → static template (the FII 450 Cr / GIFT boilerplate).
- Chart → TradingView silently fell back to Apple.
- Premiums → 0 when spot was 0.

Because nothing threw, **logs were clean and the UI looked alive** — so wrong data was indistinguishable from real data, for a long time. Graceful degradation without *honesty* (a visible "degraded" signal) is how a system lies to its own developers.

### R3. No observability — we couldn't see what the engine was doing
There was **no decision trace** (why was a candidate rejected?), **no live-vs-simulated indicator** until this session, and **no calibration monitoring**. With no window into the pipeline, issues couldn't be *noticed*, let alone measured. Development became "change something, deploy, hope" because there was no feedback signal.

### R4. Tests covered logic, not the real-world contracts
133 unit tests pass — yet the production-breaking bugs were all at the **boundaries**: Angel One's FULL-mode index rejection, the WebSocket binary frame offsets, TradingView's NSE licensing, Gemini's thinking-token budget. **None of these are exercised by unit tests** because they mock the broker/LLM/widget. The green test suite gave false confidence about a system whose failures live entirely in the integrations.

### R5. One god-class accreted all responsibility (DecisionAgent)
Features were bolted onto `DecisionAgent` rather than refactored into a pipeline. It now owns market/technical/options/risk/ML/calibration/signal-creation/order-exec/notification/persistence (audit #217). This made every change risky and **made the over-gating impossible to reason about or test in isolation** — which fed back into R1.

### R6. Config & thresholds sprawled; magic numbers everywhere
Thresholds (VIX 18, OI 50k, RSI bands, liquidity 70, score increments, premium fallbacks) are **scattered across many classes** (audit #218/#219/#222). There is no single place to see or tune "the policy," so the cumulative gating (R1) was invisible and every tweak risked side effects.

### Meta-conclusion
R1 (over-gating) explains *no trades*. R2 (silent fallbacks) + R3 (no observability) explain *why it wasn't caught*. R4 explains *why tests didn't help*. R5 + R6 explain *why it was hard to fix safely*. **The plan must address R2/R3 FIRST** — you cannot safely re-balance gates (R1) until you can see and measure what the engine rejects and whether its data is real.

## Part B — Guiding principles for the remediation

1. **Observability before surgery.** Make the engine's decisions and data-source visible *first*. Every later change must be measurable.
2. **Fail loud, not fake.** No path may return fabricated data while signalling success. Degraded = clearly flagged (chip + log + metric). (Partly done this session.)
3. **Establish a baseline, then change one thing.** Measure trade-candidate counts at each gate *before* loosening anything, so we know what each change buys.
4. **Don't fix all 226.** Most are enhancements. Sequence by *impact on trade generation*, then *risk reduction*, then *maintainability*, then *adaptive AI*.
5. **Respect the owner's risk choices.** The 2% target / ~20–40% stop and lot 65 are intentional — soften *gates*, don't silently change *risk parameters*.
6. **Verify at the boundary.** Add integration checks for the broker/LLM contracts that unit tests can't cover.

## Part C — Phased remediation plan

> Each phase has: **Goal · Tasks (→ finding refs) · Exit criteria (measurable)**. Phases are sequential; within a phase, tasks can parallelize.

### Phase 0 — Truth & Observability (do FIRST) 🔴 — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (not yet deployed)
**Goal:** make the engine's data-source and per-evaluation decisions visible and measurable. Without this we are blind.
- ✅ **DecisionTrace** — every evaluation persists {cycleId, instrument, time, direction, finalConfidence, effectiveGate, outcome, rejectStage, rejectReason, per-gate notes}. Entity + `V1.12` migration + repository; `DecisionAgent` records at every gate exit. Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/signals/decision-traces` and `GET /api/v1/signals/decision-funnel` (today's EMITTED vs REJECTED grouped by gate). Unit test asserts a risk-guard rejection is traced.
- ✅ **Gate funnel** — `decision-funnel` endpoint = candidates per reject stage (the "where do trades die" view), straight from DecisionTrace.
- ✅ **`decisionRunning` wedge fixed** — executor submission wrapped; guard released if submit throws (was a permanent hard-stop).
- ✅ **Data-integrity UNIQUE constraints** — `V1.13` dedupes + adds UNIQUE on `option_snapshot`, `market_snapshot`, `trade_result.signal_id`.
- ✅ **Startup health log** — `StartupHealthLogger` WARNs on blank Gemini key and on the `block-on-simulated-data` trade-block condition; logs provider/stream/market-hours.
- ⛔ Verify on the VM: live-feed honesty deployed (chip Live/Simulated), valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` + Angel One session. *(deploy step — yours)*
- **Exit (met in code):** you can answer from `decision-funnel` "how many candidates did each gate reject today", and from feed-status "is the feed live?"

### Phase 1 — Unblock trade generation 🔴 (the burning problem)
**Goal:** trades generate again, without abandoning capital preservation.
- **Pre-req:** feed reads **Live** (else `RiskGuardService.block-on-simulated-data` blocks everything — already fixed; just verify).
- **Soften the gate stack** (audit #1/#217; AUDIT doc T20-1): using the Phase-0 funnel data, convert hard early-returns to confidence penalties / candidate ranking. *(2 already softened this session: volatile-window, VWAP over-extension.)*
- **Continuous confidence scoring** (audit #3; T20-3): replace `ConfidenceEngine`'s 0/50/100 buckets (RSI/VWAP/PCR/Futures) with continuous functions. (verified-in-code)
- **Regime: add a BREAKOUT state + continuous trend strength** (audit #2; T20-2): `MarketRegimeAgent` is binary today. (verified-in-code)
- **Re-tune `min-direction-agreement`** (audit #2 / Phase-1 #2): 3-of-4 rarely aligns; consider 2-of-4 or weighted vote.
- **Exit:** measurable, controlled increase in trade candidates **and** generated signals vs the Phase-0 baseline (target a sane frequency, not max frequency); win-rate tracked, not crashed.

### Phase 2 — Signal quality & diagnosability 🟠
**Goal:** the trades that now generate are *good*, and we can debug them.
- `TechnicalAgent`: actually use the computed MACD / Bollinger-width / volume-ratio in scoring (audit #4; T20-4).
- `LiquidityAgent`: replace simulated spread / static OI with real depth/quote; make the floor config-driven (audit #5; T20-5).
- Data synchronization: add a **collection-cycle id** stamped across snapshot/option/candle rows; validate repo freshness on read (audit #6/#8).
- Options analytics: extend beyond PCR/OI/MaxPain toward IV/GEX where data allows (audit #11).
- Risk: optional ATR/VIX-adaptive SL/TP (audit #10) — **coordinate with owner** given the intentional 2%/40%.
- **Exit:** every generated/rejected signal has a full decision trace; liquidity reflects real book.

### Phase 3 — Architecture & maintainability 🟡
**Goal:** make future change safe (kills R5/R6).
- Decompose `DecisionAgent` → `DecisionCoordinator → ValidationPipeline → SignalFactory → ExecutionPipeline → NotificationPipeline` (audit #217/#224; T19-1).
- Centralize all thresholds/magic numbers into one typed `TradingPolicy` config (audit #218/#219/#222; T19-2).
- Separate domain model: `Signal → Order → Position → TradeResult` (audit #220).
- **Exit:** the gate policy is readable in one place; pipeline stages are independently unit-testable.

### Phase 4 — Adaptive AI 🟡
**Goal:** move from rule-engine-with-ML toward an adaptive engine (audit Phase 18).
- Calibration monitoring (predicted-vs-actual reliability curve) (audit #209; T18-2).
- Replay harness: last-90-days replay, current vs candidate engine (audit #215; T18-4) — extend existing `BacktestingEngine`.
- ML candidate re-scoring before final drop (audit #206; T18-1); later: drift detection, paper-mode exploration, feature-importance (audit #211/#212/#216).
- **Exit:** changes can be A/B-replayed offline before deploy; confidence is calibrated.

### Cross-cutting — Prevent recurrence (start in Phase 0, sustain)
- **No silent fallbacks rule:** any fallback must set a `degraded` flag surfaced to UI + logs + a metric. Add a test that asserts simulated paths flag themselves.
- **Boundary/integration checks:** smoke tests or a `/health/live-data` check that hits the real Angel One quote and asserts a sane spot (catches R4-class bugs like FULL-mode index rejection).
- **Config centralization** (Phase 3) so cumulative gating is always visible.
- Keep the three docs in sync as items land.

## Part D — Fill the audit's gaps with our own code-verified review
The PDF left the **most trade-critical components summary-only or undelivered**: Phase 3 (DecisionAgent), 4 (MarketRegimeAgent), 5 (RiskGuardService), 6 (OptionsAgent), and 8–16 (Liquidity, MultiTimeframe, ML/ONNX, SignalGenerator, Collector, Scheduler, Repository, DB, Production stability). These overlap heavily with Phase-1/2 work. **Action:** during Phase 0/1, run a focused code-verified pass over these specific classes and append real, file/line-grounded findings to `ENGINE_REVIEW_ALL_ISSUES.md` so the picture is complete and trustworthy (not LLM-"plausible").

---

## Part E — Sequencing & first concrete steps
1. **Commit & deploy** the in-flight `fix/production-data-chain` branch (run migrations V1.9–V1.11); confirm the feed reads **Live**. *(This alone may restore some trading, since the simulated-feed risk-block was a hard blocker.)*
2. **Phase 0**: build the DecisionTrace + gate-funnel logging; capture a **baseline** (candidates per gate, trades/day).
3. **Phase 1**: with baseline in hand, soften gates + continuous confidence + breakout regime; measure the delta.
4. Proceed to Phase 2 → 3 → 4, measuring at each step.

> **Do not** start Phase 1 gate-loosening before Phase 0 observability + a confirmed Live feed — otherwise we repeat R1/R3 (changing gates blind).

## Part F — Effort & risk snapshot
| Phase | Rough effort | Risk if skipped |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Observability | S–M | Flying blind; can't measure any fix |
| 1 Unblock trades | M | The core symptom persists |
| 2 Signal quality | M–L | Trades generate but are low-quality |
| 3 Architecture | L | Every future change stays risky |
| 4 Adaptive AI | L | Engine stays static, slowly stale |

_Owner sign-off needed before changing any risk parameter (target/stop/lot) or enabling live order placement._
